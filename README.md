```

## How to use suseforma:

Suseforma is a modified copy of sumaform, but for generic usage, not spacewalk specific.


Suseforma is basically terraform, libvirtd (https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt) with salt.

It's just a quick generic scheleton, to show people how to benift from this 2 tools in a generic way.


So we use terraform for setup network, machines, disks etc, and salt for provisioning the machine.

The control-node machine, is a concept to orchestrate machines. Take this if you wish.
 In spacewalk-testsuite(https://github.com/SUSE/spacewalk-testsuite-base), we run cucumber code inside the control-node that orchestrate the multiples-machines.


You could also use susetest, for just simpy run multiple machines test in python.
